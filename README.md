# ESLint-Config-Haykam

This configuration for ESLint is based off the style that I program in. It is used in as many of my projects as possible, and I do accept issues and pull requests to projects of mine that do not use this config yet.

## Installation

Use `npm` to install:

    npm install --save-dev eslint-config-haykam

## Usage

Add this to your `.eslintrc.json` file:

```json
{
  "extends": "eslint-config-haykam"
}
```
